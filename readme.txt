== Description ==

Create Facebook Events Through Your WordPress Admin.  WP Facebook Events easily integrates WordPress with your Facebook Events.  You are able to create, edit, and display your Facebook Events on your WordPress blog.


Installing this plugin is really quite easy.
First and foremost, you will need to upload the plugin file into your WordPress Plugin directory.

Configuration:
Now that you have the plugin installed and activated, it is now time for you to configure it!
In your settings dropdown list, and then click on the "Facebook Events" option.
Now that you are on the Facebook Events Management page, you are able to both input your Facebook Application settings and create an Event outside of a post (just another option for you). 
If the App Settings don't automatically show up, just click on the "App Settings" link and the settings options drop-down.

Setting Up An Application:
Just like with any Facebook Plugin or API, you will need Application Credentials.
First, let's head over to Facebook's Developer Area and Create an App: http://developers.facebook.com/setup/ and insert the appropriate information (site name, URL...etc.)

Create a New Facebook Event
Awesome! Now that everything is setup, you are ready to rock with creating new Facebook Events! You can setup a new Facebook Event through the Facebook Events Management panel, or straight through your Page/Post creation area.
Now let's head over to the Posts creation area, and create a new post. You will now see a new box under the content area that says "Create FB Event" in the title. Now, just place in your content/information into the associated fields.
You will then be given an Event Id to place within the content area of your Post or Page. Your Event ID will look something like: [eventdetails id=11111111111111]
You can also head over to the Facebook Events Management panel and view a list of your events and their associated ID with a link to the Facebook Events Page.
